**description :** Juniors Training Road Map [Sheet](http://goo.gl/unDETI) by [Mostafa S. ibrahim](https://sites.google.com/site/mostafasibrahim/)

**Thoughts :** I'll consider this as my first day, but i've started before (reading cp 3rd edition, and now i reached linear data structure section).
\
I've read the Sheet's info & FAQ, then i started solving CF-A problems.

This is my copy of the [Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qXqshJ3dKZpJuw8_fL6NJQuMdYwK5T8K8aUqY_v-_Dw/edit?usp=sharing)
