# Let's Start :) 

> `DAY 0` : August 15, 2018
**description :** Juniors Training Road Map [Sheet](http://goo.gl/unDETI) by [Mostafa S. ibrahim](https://sites.google.com/site/mostafasibrahim/)

**Thoughts :** I'll consider this as my first day, but i've started before (reading cp 3rd edition, and now i reached linear data structure section).
\
I've read the Sheet's info & FAQ, then i started solving CF-A problems.
\
This is my copy of the [Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qXqshJ3dKZpJuw8_fL6NJQuMdYwK5T8K8aUqY_v-_Dw/edit?usp=sharing).
\
Get to know about two pointers and apply it for [CF381-D2-A](http://codeforces.com/contest/381/problem/A).

> `DAY 1` : August 17, 2018
**description :** Measuring Algorithms Performance + Elementary Math

**Thoughts :** It was kinda revision.
\
I participated in codeforces contest.

---

> `DAY 2` : August 18, 2018
**description :** Learn basic number theory (skype call with experienced friend from mcpc).

**Thoughts :** He taught us Modular arithmetic.
\
I also learnt Combinatorics by watching some videos (and from wikipedia).
\
I participated in codeforces educational round.

> `DAY 3` : August 19, 2018
**description :** Continue with Sheet's problems.

**Thoughts :** I participated in codeforces' round and increased my rating for the 1st time since a while (i was always afraid from participating, but i decided that i'll participate in every round).
\
solving problems in [MCPCRR] Week#1: this is a challenge lunched by our community (contest each week of 20 problems) in order to be ready for the next MCPC.

> `DAY 4` : August 20, 2018
**description :** I really enjoy the MCPC training contest.

**Thoughts :** To day i solved 10 problems out of 20, (i'm participating alone against teams of other faculties here in morocco so that i can evaluate my improvement).
\
I learnt some new stuff in number theory **[Sieve of Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes)**, **[Quadratic sieve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_sieve)**.
\
I also learnt new data structure [Trie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie).
