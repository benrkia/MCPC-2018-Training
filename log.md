# Let's Start :) 

> `DAY 0` : August 15, 2018
**description :** Juniors Training Road Map [Sheet](http://goo.gl/unDETI) by [Mostafa S. ibrahim](https://sites.google.com/site/mostafasibrahim/)

**Thoughts :** I'll consider this as my first day, but i've started before (reading cp 3rd edition, and now i reached linear data structure section).
\
I've read the Sheet's info & FAQ, then i started solving CF-A problems.
\
This is my copy of the [Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qXqshJ3dKZpJuw8_fL6NJQuMdYwK5T8K8aUqY_v-_Dw/edit?usp=sharing).
\
Get to know about two pointers and apply it for [CF381-D2-A](http://codeforces.com/contest/381/problem/A).

> `DAY 1` : August 17, 2018
**description :** Measuring Algorithms Performance + Elementary Math

**Thoughts :** It was kinda revision.
\
I participated in codeforces contest.

---

> `DAY 2` : August 18, 2018
**description :** Learn basic number theory (skype call with experienced friend from mcpc).

**Thoughts :** He taught us Modular arithmetic.
\
I also learnt Combinatorics by watching some videos (and from wikipedia).
\
I participated in codeforces educational round.

---

> `DAY 3` : August 19, 2018
**description :** Continue with Sheet's problems.

**Thoughts :** I participated in codeforces' round and increased my rating for the 1st time since a while (i was always afraid from participating, but i decided that i'll participate in every round).
\
solving problems in [MCPCRR] Week#1: this is a challenge lunched by our community (contest each week of 20 problems) in order to be ready for the next MCPC.
\
i learnt largest increasing subsequence.

---

> `DAY 4` : August 20, 2018
**description :** I really enjoy the MCPC training contest.

**Thoughts :** To day i solved 10 problems out of 20, (i'm participating alone against teams of other faculties here in morocco so that i can evaluate my improvement).
\
I learnt some new stuff in number theory **[Sieve of Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes)**, **[Quadratic sieve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_sieve)**.
\
I also learnt new data structures **[Trie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie)** and **[Segment tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segment_tree)**.

---

> `DAY 5` : August 21, 2018
**description :** Continue with the mcpc training contest.

**Thoughts :** today i applied what i've learned in number theory by solving a new problem in the training contest.
\
I also learnt my first game theory algorithm and apply it to solve a problem in the training contest.
\
I also learnt one of the most used algorithm in competitive programming (KMP string matching) in order to solve a problem in the training contest.

---

> `DAY 6` : August 22, 2018
**description :** Today is Eid Al Adha here in morocco, so Happy eid for all moroccan and muslims.

**Thoughts :** I reached the 7th place by solving 13 problems out of 20, i'm realy proud of what i've done, in this 3 days of contest i learnt more than 3 new algorithms and apply them.
\
today i solved one problem using **[Bipartite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartite_graph)**, and graph coloring.
\
in this problem i used bipartite graph to check if my graph can be colored using 2 colors or not.

---

> `DAY 7` : August 23, 2018
**description :** Continue with the contest i'm now the 7th by solving 14 problems.

**Thoughts :** Today i used **[Dijkstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm)** to solve a problem.
\
i also learnt how to use dynamic programming on strings.

---

> `DAY 8` : August 25, 2018
**description :** Back to the sheet and Hackerearth.

**Thoughts :** continue the sheet's problem, and for new topic i used hackerearth to learn and to apply. (i learnt some new maths).

---

> `DAY 9` : August 26, 2018
**description :** Number theory 1 from Hackerearth.

**Thoughts :** I've completed the 1st part of number theory from Hackerearth, it was really great and enjoying. i learnt lot of new technics (since almost i knew all the subtopics already, but now i know the best ways to implement them.

---

> `DAY 10` : August 27, 2018
**description :** Complete the NON-LINEAR DS WITH BUILT-IN LIBRARIES.

**Thoughts :** I've completed the 3rd part of section 2 from competitive programming 3rd edition, where i learnt **[BST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree)**, **[Self-balancing binary search tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-balancing_binary_search_tree)** and **[Priority queue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priority_queue)**.

---

> `DAY 11` : August 30, 2018
**description :** Solve all the exercices of the section.

**Thoughts :** In order to revise what i've learnt i solved all the exercices of the section 2.3.

---

> `DAY 12` : August 31, 2018
**description :** Solve UVA problem that has relation with the studied section.

**Thoughts :** To apply what i've learnt in real problems, i've solved the starred problems of the studied section (2.3).

---

> `DAY 13` : September 1, 2018
**description :** CP Jam the 2nd edition.

**Thoughts :** An event organized by the moroccan competitive programming community, where i've learnt new topic (Square Root Decomposition with some application).
\
And we've done a contest where i've solved 4 problems out of 7, which is a big improvement for me :).
